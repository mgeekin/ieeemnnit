# OFFICE BEARERS

A Student Branch gives students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field. An active IEEE Student Branch can be one of the most positive elements in a department offering programs in IEEE designated fields of Engineering, Computer Science, and Information Technology and others as listed at http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/qualifications/qualifications.html. IEEE Student Branches are established at over 1,500 universities and colleges throughout the world. Student Branch activities offer numerous educational, technical, and professional advantages of IEEE membership through special projects, activities, meetings, tours and field trips.
